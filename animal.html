      <hr>
      <p> Animal is a dark action drama about Ranvijay Singh and his troubled relationship with his father Balbir Singh, a rich industrialist and pretty much the most powerful man in the country. As a kid, Ranvijay always wanted his father's attention and validation, but its absence ended up turning him into a violent and rebellious youngster who resorted to violence and brute force to solve problems, much to the chagrin of Balbir, who disapproved of his methods and sent him to boarding school. After returning home as an adult, he found himself unfavorably compared to his estranged brother-in-law and ended up saying something which prompted Balbir to kick him out once again. Ranvijay married his childhood sweetheart Gitanjali and moved to the US, and a cold war began between the father-son duo which abruptly ended after an assassination attempt on Balbir. Now, Ranvijay is ready to put his differences aside and plots vengeance against those who tried to kill Balbir, once again resorting to violence to solve this problem. As a result, the violence and bloodshed escalates and takes a heavy toll on his life and psyche, turning him into a cold-blooded animal who will stop at nothing in his pursuit of twisted vengeance</p>
